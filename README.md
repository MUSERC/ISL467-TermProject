Helmet Detection using Faster R-CNN and YOLOv8

Project Overview

Hey there! This project is a term project for ITU ISL467, supervised by Tuncay Özcan. The goal? To compare two object detection models—Faster R-CNN and YOLOv8—specifically for detecting helmets in industrial safety applications. We wanted to see how they stack up in terms of accuracy, speed, and computational cost.
